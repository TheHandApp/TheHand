# Thanks
This project is inspired by [calibre][calibre] and [WordPress-Android][WordPress-Android-github]

Also many thanks to seaking who come up with the amazing name.The invisible hand is a wellknown metaphor in econoics,which we bought the idea here
to allude to The Economist,or free market it has always supported.FYI,in George RR Martin's master piece "A song of ice and fire",King's hand could 
roughly be interpreted as Prime Minister,that is to say,government and politics,I believe the two ideas combine will fairly match that of The Economist.
